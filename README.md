Yet Another Testing &amp; Auditing Solution

The goal of YATAS is to help you create a secure AWS environment without too much hassle. It won't check for all best practices but only for the ones that are important for you based on my experience. Please feel free to tell me if you find something that is not covered.

## Features
YATAS is a simple and easy to use tool to audit your infrastructure for misconfiguration or potential security issues.
